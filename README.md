# 🧠 Virtual Reality Website – Immersive Web Experience

Welcome to my Virtual Reality website!  
This is an experimental and interactive VR experience built for the web. Using modern web technologies and immersive design elements, it allows users to explore a 3D environment right from their browser — no headset required (though it's compatible with VR devices too)!

## 🌐 What It Does

- Lets users experience a virtual space directly in the browser
- Supports cursor or motion-based interaction (depending on setup)
